Type of data that could prove useful for the app

```
landed a position with swift. Going to stick with them for a year and then move onto local. Thanks for all the help everyone.Just received my CDL a few days ago from 160 driving academy. I attempted to find a local job, I’ve looked through about 40-50 ads for local gigs and can’t find a single one that hires without experience. I started looking for Megas to join to get some experience. Here are my first few results…Werner-does not hire graduates from 160. Rhoel- does not hire out of my state. Prime- recruiter says they have no trainers to train inexperienced drivers at the moment. Marten - 6 months experience required. Heartland express - 6 months experienceDoes anyone know any companies that hire out of California for inexperienced drivers?

General job seeking advice

```
It's a bit old fashioned but a lot of small local operations like landscapers, gravel haulers,
propane gas providers, etc., advertise locally only because it's too expensive to advertise nationally.Also check with your local workforce (unemployment office). They usually have weekly job fairs that almost always have CDL A jobs.
